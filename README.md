# SENTIMENT-ANALYZER
### The objective of this project is to develop a multi-class emotion-based sentiment classifier
using deep learning. The solution leverages BERT,(Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers) a powerful transformer-based language model, to encode the contextual
meaning of text and classify it into one of the following categories: happy, sad, angry, surprise,
disgust, or not-relevant.
